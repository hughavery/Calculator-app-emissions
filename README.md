# Greenhouse gas calculator application

This application is a visual representation of a model created in a final year Software Engineering project to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions created annually 
through working from home and working from the office. The calculator prompts the user throuh a series of questions about commutes to work, video conferencing details and heating usage when working from home. 

The application is currently purely client side, running with the React framework and MUI components. Future additions include storage of user results to show population averages and trends.
